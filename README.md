#  Global Development Rhythms Analysis

A comprehensive analysis tool for understanding contribution patterns across different time zones in popular open-source projects. This project helps visualize how developers worldwide collaborate throughout their working days.

##  Key Features

- Temporal analysis of commit patterns across multiple repositories
- Visualization of contribution distributions across time zones
- Statistical insights into global development workflows
- Extensible architecture for custom repository analysis

##  Getting Started

Install dependencies```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure GitHub API access- Generate a personal access token at [GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Replace `'SEU_TOKEN_AQUI'` in `src/github_api.py` with your token

Run the analysis```bash
python main.py
```

##  Output Visualizations

### Temporal Distribution Analysis

- Hourly commit frequency visualization across time zones
- Interactive plots showing contribution patterns
- Statistical summaries of development activity

### Heatmap Visualization

- Comprehensive view of commit distribution
- Color-coded intensity mapping
- Clear temporal pattern identification

##  Customization Options

Add repositoriesModify the `repositories` list in `main.py` to include additional projectsAdjust analysis parametersConfigure time windows and visualization options in the configuration fileExtend functionalityAdd custom metrics and visualizations through the modular architecture##  Technical Considerations

### Rate Limiting

- GitHub API rate limits apply to all requests
- Built-in delay mechanisms prevent API restrictions
- Optimized batch processing for efficient data collection

### Data Collection

- Analysis based on available commit history
- Time zone detection from commit timestamps
- Robust error handling for missing data points

##  Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Submit pull requests or open issues to:

- Add new visualization types
- Implement additional metrics
- Enhance repository selection criteria
- Improve documentation

##  Documentation

Detailed technical documentation is maintained in the `docs` directory, including:

- API usage guidelines
- Development setup instructions
- Testing procedures
- Code contribution standards

##  Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the open-source community for maintaining the repositories analyzed by this tool. Your contributions help us understand global development patterns better.
